# yourData Browser Extension

Works with Firefox for now. Draws heavily on the following example extensions from MDN:

* [Annotate page](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/annotate-page)
* [List cookies](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/master/list-cookies)

## Play with the extension

Clone the repo.

Open  Firefox Debugging tools: [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)

Choose "Load temporary Add-on"
