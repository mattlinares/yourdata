# yourData

The web needs tools to show users how they are tracked and segmented, giving them easy visibility and control over the data and algorithms that shape what they see online.

yourData is a set of standards and patterns to enable the front-end display of personal data which is being used to customise a given piece of web content.

This project will research the following elements to make this protocol applicable to other systems.

- An [ontology](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) of demographic user data 
- Guidelines and patterns for applying the ontology within other frameworks e.g. CMSs
- Process guidelines e.g. for integrating such a featureset into organisational GDPR activity
- Graphical assets to familiarise users with the protocol thus increasing data accessibility
- A list of projects which effectively implement yourData on other systems e.g. Django / Wagtail



This project is an attempt to provide tools and set standards for user data transparency across the web. We are keen to hear of other projects with similar aims.

We are also keen for collaborators, contributors, sponsors and supporters of all sorts. Please email matthew.linares  -@-  opendemocracy.net
